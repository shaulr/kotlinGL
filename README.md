# kotlin-opengl-testing
This is an Android Studio project following the [Displaying Graphics with OpenGL ES](https://developer.android.com/training/graphics/opengl/index.html) Android developer training classes using Kotlin.
There are also a few of my own additions, most notably being able to make the pinch zoom in and out gestures to change the OpenGL camera position in my custom GLSurfaceView.

## How to use this project in Android Studio
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio using the menu bar: File -> Open... or Open an existing Android Studio project if no project is open.
3. Navigate to the folder, press okay and then Run the project on a connected Android device or virtual device.
